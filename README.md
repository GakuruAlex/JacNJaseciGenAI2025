# Generative AI Training #

This a walk along of the generative AI course offered by Open University of Kenya and BCS Technology International Pty Limited, Australia using the BCS Jaseci Lab ecosystem to learn and gain practical experience in integrating and deploying AI applications.

# tour of Jac #
Jac is a drop-in replacement for Python and supersets Python, much like Typescript supersets Javascript or C++ supersets C. It extends Python's semantics while maintaining full interoperability with the Python ecosystem, introducing cutting-edge abstractions designed to minimize complexity and embrace AI-forward development.
